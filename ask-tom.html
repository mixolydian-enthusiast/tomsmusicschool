	<span class="question_date">Jan 21, 2022 10:40 AM</span>
	<div class="question_asked">yo man i was checking out ur music earlier and i found a chord that really just stuck with me i dont know how u did it but i think you may have just invented a new chord so check this out there is a moment in ur simfonietta for the broken oboe, specifically at the 32:53 mark, where you play a chord that has the notes C E G</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Yeah, that's a basic C major triad.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">im really trying to figure out what u did there and at first i was like, that must be a rootless Am7.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Nah, it's just a C major.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">but then im like no, this has to be a Bb13#11(no5)/C</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">That's what I was thinking at first, but then I changed my mind.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">this chord is now an extension of me</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Funnily enough, my original triad has no extensions.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">its just so complex and intricate, sharply dissonant with extra spice</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">I'm glad it's making you feel this way, I thought I should have included a polychord there.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">it feels like it is deeply rooted in the cosmos, it has life and beauty but i can also hear the tragedy and fragility of existence</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Yeah you may wanna check with your otolaryngologist there, and possibly psychiatrist.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">imagination, brilliance, poetry, the beauty of Art and Life synopsized into one tiny moment captured in the vastness and coldness of space and time</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Space is pretty big.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">i hear the oboi playing your GaltDm7b5addnat10add#12#15/Bb&#119082;augminmaj7</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Whoah, you're just making stuff up now.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">and im filled with a sense of urgency and inadequacy but also relief and safety.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Ah yes, that's what I meant when I wrote it.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">i can feel the strong socio-political statement emerging from those three notes</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">I try to be vocal about stuff, like when I write vocal music.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">and the phrasing, wow, so intentional and heartwarming, tragically comical, but also dramatic and introspective</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">I think it's just a sustained triad played through General MIDI.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">you can feel the spring of a lost time, flowing through the sweet timbré of this silky textural conglomeration</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">What the heck are you talking abou- I mean yeah, it was all carefully crafted.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">there is complexity in the simplicity, and some say its a simple c major triad</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">YES!!! YES!! BECAUSE IT IS!!!</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">but those are just haters and naysayers</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">I can see that.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">but what makes your brilliant art piece even better is the chord that follows immediately after</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">(Isn't the next chord also C major?)</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">a chord with the notes B#, G triple flat and Bb double flat duodecuple sharp</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Are you sure you are following standard enharmonic spelling procedures?</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">where do i even start</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">How about Tom Gerou's and Linda Lusk's Essential Dictionary of Musical Notation?</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">this chord sucks</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Ouch.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">BUT</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Oh no.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">coupled with the first chord, contextually speaking, forms a cadence unprecedented in musical history</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">I think I might be retiring from show business.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">this super-ultra-hyper-mega-meta-lydian-aeolian-exotic-bird-superlocrian-hypophrygian-double-harmonic-major-subdominant-plagal-suspension-chain-tritone-substitution-rhythmic-displacement-negative-macroharmony cadence sends a message</div>

	<div class="question_answer">I wish it didn't.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">the message of love and peace </div>
