<p><marquee>Here at Tom's Music School we use the deprecated marquee tag because it reminds us of the olden golden days of Vaudeville! Oh gee whiz Louise what a swell day, boy does it make ya wanna tap dance merrily with your gal! Wait a timebit. Is that Tom? Why I'll be darned, I better stop the gobbledygook and finish up my typewriting in no time flat!</marquee></p>

  <h2>&#9836; CLASSES WE OFFER &#9836;</h2>
 
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Applied Swingification:</strong> Level up your fine songs to the next level by swingifying ’em to the point that people break their back just by listening to them. You can actually swingify any song, even already swung songs. You need to have a lot of swing for this. If you think you might be low on swing, test your swing levels first at our Swing Meter Medical Center.</li>
	
    <li><strong>Broken Classical:</strong> Receive professional instruction on how to butcher classical music. Rebel against the written note by playing a note of your preference instead, sing opera with marbles in your mouth and learn how to break the concert hall etiquette! Every virtuoso classical butcherer is a classical butcherer, but not every classical butcherer is a virtuoso classical butcherer!</li>
	
    <li><strong>The Art of Groovechestration:</strong> Perhaps the finest class, taught by Tom himself, here you learn to orchestrate by watching the master himself at work. Tom will be scribbling on the chalkboard incomprehensibly for several hours on end and you will be in awe and pretend you learned at least 1 thing. (Note: The class is reserved for the best students.)</li>
	
    <li><strong>Rage Against the Machines:</strong> Here Tom takes you to the local music store. There, you smash to pieces as many electronic instruments as you can and you get groovypoints (electronic triangle: 25.1 groovypoints, electric guitar: 251 groovypoint- never mind, in honor of Silly-Willie, Tom will exempt that, Roland TR-808: 251k groovypoints etc.). You can use your groovypoints to unlock music books from the Groove City Library, including classics such as “Harmony and Voice Misleading”, “Twentieth Century Cacophony” etc.</li>
	
    <li><strong>Unpaid Internship to The Too Late Night Show with Tom Grooves for an Indefinite Amount of Time (Optional):</strong> What better way to refine your music skills by serving Tom some hot chocolate!</li>
	
    <li>Pete too! (~Not Pete.)</li>
  </ul>
